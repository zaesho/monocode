//! Calls from the runtime into the other engine packages.
//!
//! The TypeScript app had call cycles between submit, the orchestrator, the
//! message queue, and remote. Here each package fills in the hook trait it
//! owns, and every method has a no-op default, so `runtime` builds and runs
//! with no other package present.
//!
//! Rules for implementations:
//! - The runtime calls most hooks while it holds the `Sessions` entity, so a
//!   hook must not read or update `Sessions`. The runtime passes what it knows
//!   as arguments instead. Methods documented as "called outside `Sessions`"
//!   may touch it.
//! - Hooks that return a `Task` run their work themselves and return
//!   `Task::ready(..)` when there is nothing to do.

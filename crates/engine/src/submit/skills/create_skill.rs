# Create a MonoCode skill

Write a portable Agent Skill so every harness (Claude, Cursor, Codex, Grok Build, OpenCode, Pi, omp, fx, Hermes Agent, Factory Droid) can load it.

## Storage (required)

| Scope | Path |
|-------|------|
| This project | `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Personal (all projects) | `~/.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |

Never write skills to `.claude/skills`, `.cursor/skills`, `~/.cursor/skills-cursor`, `.fx/skills`, `~/.hermes/skills`, `.factory/skills`, or any other harness-only folder. One copy under `.agents/skills` is enough.

Ask where it should live if the user did not say. Default to the project when a project folder is open.

## Gather before writing

1. **Purpose** — what task this skill owns
2. **Scope** — project vs personal
3. **Triggers** — when the agent should use it (put these in `description`)
4. **Domain knowledge** the model would not already know
5. **Output format** — templates, names, style
6. **Verbatim text** — if the user gave exact wording, use it unchanged

Infer from the conversation when it is already clear. Do not ask questions you can answer from context.

## File layout

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # required
├── reference.md       # optional, details the agent reads only when needed
├── examples.md        # optional
└── scripts/           # optional helpers
```

## SKILL.md format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: What it does and when to use it. Include trigger terms.
---

# Title

## Instructions
...
```

- `name`: lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens; max 64 characters; must match the folder name
- `description`: third person; WHAT + WHEN; max 1024 characters. This is how the picker and the model decide to use the skill.
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines. Put long reference material in sibling files and link them one level deep.

### Description

Good: "Review pull requests against team standards. Use when asked to review a PR, diff, or code change."
Bad: "Helps with code." / "I can review PRs."

## Authoring rules

- The model is already smart. Only write what it cannot guess.
- Prefer concrete steps, checklists, and examples over essays.
- One default approach, plus an escape hatch. Do not list five equivalent tools.
- POSIX paths only (`scripts/helper.py`, never `scripts\\helper.py`).
- No dates that will rot. Put legacy notes in an "Old patterns" section.

## After writing

1. Confirm the file path
2. Confirm name + description
3. Do not copy the skill into harness-specific folders
